## amuse_um collection management system
amuse_um is a basic collections management system suitable for a small to medium museum or an individual collector. It is written in JavaScript and uses a sub-set of JSON, HTML (including HTML5 FILE API) and CSS. It can run off-line with any modern web browser on a desktop or mobile and can also be accessed through cloud services such as Google Drive.

amuse_um JSON is a sub-set of JSON that uses only the basic type String and a one-dimensional Array of Strings for its values. At the top level of name/value pairs, only one pair with the name "objects" has a JSON Object as its value and this describes each museum object in a collection, using the collection's 'object number'.

For more information about amuse_um JSON and how amuse_um JSON Objects may be viewed and edited, see [wiki](https://github.com/tonykitto/amuse_um/wiki).
